        Bangladeshis are renowned for their hospitality and warmth – they’ll invite you home and treat you to their delectable cuisine. They are passionate about food, football, cricket, theatre and music – and if you’re wondering about the strange combination, their social ambit is wide and they are a broad-minded nation. Bangladesh is among the few Asian nations where religions coexist in harmony. However, don’t be fooled by the smooth and urbane capital city, Dhaka – the smaller cities and villages are simple and well behind modern times.
